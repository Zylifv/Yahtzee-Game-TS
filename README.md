My take on the dice game, Yahtzee!

I wanted to try and create my own version of Yahtzee which was inspired from Balatro. I like the abilities presented in that game so that the player can munipulate outcomes with variance. I want to first make a Yahtzee game that plays normally, then introduce ways the player can alter dice-rolls, use abilties, gain dice etc

Things to do:

Resolve the scoring system effectively (user chooses which way to score & go to next round when applicable) - DONE > Complete. I managed to trim the code down and allow for each type of score to be allowed once.
Minimise repeat code (remove all un-necessary code eventually) > Implementing the DRY method to most of the code, i still need to refine some areas.
Have a way to track which options the player has already used when choosing how to score - DONE
Maybe have a score the player must try to beat? (Single player progeression system) - DONE
Eventually add different ways the player can change outcomes with card effects, such as: > Adding an extra dice for one roll > Having dice only roll odd or even for one roll > Guaranteeing a dice rolls how you want (choose the number) > One less dice in a round gives currency? (Add option for currency like other games) > Betting on a certain score category awards a way to upgrade the score for that outcome? (Betting on a full-house, then rolling one upgrades its score by 0.1% etc.)

I have now implemented a way for the user to click a one-time use button to change the rolls of a round of dice to be only even or odd numbers, giving the player more agency in how they approach the game. I will continue to add things like this later on.
